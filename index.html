		<h1>The Rebuilding of Bay Ridge Volunteer Fire Company</h1>
		<p>Client: Bay Ridge Volunteer Fire Company Inc</p>
		<p>Website URL: <a href="http://www.bayridgefire.com">www.bayridgefire.com</a></p>
		<p>Project: Website Redesign</p>
		<p>Designer: Russell Chatham Jr.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
		<h3>Site Intent</h3>
		<p>The current website was designed approximately 5 years ago.  I am the person who did the original design using a template that I purchased from a online store.  Although the website is useful, it is lacking the ability for mobile use, ease of use and interaction by those who view and use the website.</p>
		<p>One of the many goals for the redesign of the website is to make it be a responsive website.  When you view the current website on a tablet or a mobile phone, you have to zoom in to read what is on the page.  Pictures do not format correctly and appear large.  The website incorporates flash which on most mobile devices does not work correctly or at all.  One of the other features that they would like on the website is for the Secretary and the Officer in charge of training to be able to upload the minutes and training schedule into the members area with out having to retype it or email it to me to post.</p>

		<h3>Pages to Design</h3>

			<li>Home Page</li>
			<li>About Us</li>
			<li>Apparatus</li>
			<li>Members</li>
			<li>Photo Gallery</li>
			<li>Members Only Page</li>
			<li>Fire Prevention Page</li>
			<li>Contact Us</li>

		<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
		<p>Based on research of other Fire Companies in the area, Bay Ridge Volunteer Fire Company's website doesn't offer a lot of features for the user.  The gallery is just folders with pictures in it.  The member area is confusing with multiple levels to get to where you want to go.  The colors of the website compared to other fire companies is different and makes the user wonder what type of website they are visiting.  To achieve the goal of being ranked higher, to showcase what Bay Ridge Vol. Fire Company is all about and to bring the website to current standards.<p>

  		<td>Bob Bulman - 2nd Assistant Chief</br>
  		Bob would like there to be a way that each month instead of having to print off the calendar then email a hard copy to the webmaster.  Once the webmaster has the copy of the calendar it has to be retyped into the website so it can be displayed.  He would like to eliminate all these steps and be able to set the calendar and it will be uploaded to the "Members Only" section. Then members can print them off from there or click on a link to download to Google Calendar, iCalendar or Outlook Calendar.</td>

		Age: 44</br>
		Income: $48,000</br>
		Marilee doesn't visit the site often.  The different times she has been there she got confused when looking for pictures of when the dam broke.  With all the links to other pages on the site she found it easier to search the internet to find pictures.  SHe would like to see a photo gallery that is easy to use.  Another feature Marilee would like is something that younger kids can learn about Fire Prevention.  The page for that needs to encourage kids to learn about Fire Prevention.</td>
